Project 2: Who Wants to be a Millionaire? 
Julia Konopka 

For my second attempt, I did not use the XML, I used the Jetpack Compose. 
I created a whole new project and started fresh. 

I referenced the previous homeworks and projects for layouts and page navigation like LunchTray App and UserActivity (Project1), along with the additional examples from Android Developer. 

I did use AI for assistance with small erros and debugging but mainly focused on using my own knowledge and previous assignments from the semester, as I should have the first time to complete the project. 

In the upload I included two mp4s like the last submission for the win and lose endings, along with screenshots of the main screen and code. 

I kept majority of the same question and kept the images that I used previously. 
Found and changed some of the questions with ones I found on this site:

Added the Icon, to the assests to make the app logo:
